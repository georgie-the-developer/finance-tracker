Basic functionality: 
    Home page:
        - display expense/income table at home page;
        - display account balance;
        - specify a currency;
        - be able to filter the table values by date / category / type / sum of money;
        - be able to add new expense info (specify a sum of money, a type (expense or income), a category and date (optionally));
    Statistics page:
        - display one filter-sensitive dynamic chart (you can filter the info by date / category / type; you can also choose the chart type (pie or columns))

How should charts work:
 - last week: every expense of past 7 days, sorted by date, if there are multiple expenses during one day they are reduced to one, labels are weekdays, shortened;
 - last month: every expense of past 30 days, sorted by date, if there are multiple expenses during one day they are reduced to one, labels are day numbers + number of month;
 - last year: expense chart where each datapoint is a reduced value of a particular month, labels are months.
 - if bar goes below zero, it is red, if it is higher than zero, it is green. if a value is 0 the place for that bar should still be reserved.
